# Real-time CV Generator with React useContext Hook

This Expo project allows you to generate a dynamic CV with real-time data updates using the React useContext hook. This is a basic template to get you started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`).
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcellintacite/hng-internship-mobile.git

   ```

2. Go to stage2 folder

   ```bash
   cd stage2

   ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Running the Project
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This will start the development server and open the Expo DevTools in your default web browser. You can then choose to run the app on an emulator/simulator or a physical device.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your code editor and explore the src directory. You will find the main components and context for the CV generation.

2. Customize the CV template and data to meet your needs. The real-time updates are handled through React's useContext hook, so make sure to update the context appropriately.

3. Add your own styles and additional functionality as required.

4. Test your changes using the Expo development server, and make any necessary adjustments.


## Contributing

2. Create a new branch from the main branch for your feature or bug fix.

3. Make your changes and ensure the project still works as expected.

4. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.

5. Push your changes to your forked repository.

6. Create a pull request to merge your changes back into the main repository.
